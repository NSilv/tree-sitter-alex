# Alex Tree-sitter grammar

Very incomplete alex tree sitter grammar.
Right now it really only lets you highlight the haskell part of alex files - as long as you have a tree-sitter haskell parser available.

## TODO

- [ ] write grammar for the alex part of the files
- [ ] test that it all works
- [ ] learn more about tree-sitter so I can understand it all better
